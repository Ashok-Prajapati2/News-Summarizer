          "content": "The concept of Explainable AI has become increasingly relevant as black-box models like deep learning continue to dominate. XAI aims to make AI systems more transparent and interpretable to end-users, especially in industries like healthcare, where understanding the decision-making process is critical. Traditional models, despite their high accuracy, often lack transparency, making it difficult for stakeholders to trust their outcomes. XAI addresses this by offering insights into how models reach their conclusions, which can lead to better accountability and improved decision-making.",
