Published on September 11 in the journal Nature, this breakthrough represents a step forward over traditional digital computers in which data storage and processing are limited to just two states, the IISc said."

These developments are currently restricted to resource-heavy data centres, due to a lack of energy-efficient hardware. With silicon electronics nearing saturation, designing brain-inspired accelerators that can work alongside silicon chips to deliver faster, more efficient AI is also becoming crucial."
