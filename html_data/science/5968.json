If you want to parse this JSON structure to create an HTML page, you could do it with a JavaScript function:

```javascript
var htmlData = {
  "html": [
    "<p>The mission, which included the world’s first all civilian spacewalk, returned to Earth after being five days in orbit and featured a commercial spacewalk.</p>",
    "<p>2024 ON asteroid is passing at a safe distance, but its speed is still a concern.</p>",
    // ... rest of the html
  ]
};

var htmlContent = htmlData.html.join("");
document.body.innerHTML = htmlContent;
```

Note: This code will overwrite any content in the body of the HTML document. If you want to append this content to an existing page, you should create a new element and append it to the body:

```javascript
var container = document.createElement("div");
container.innerHTML = htmlContent;
document.body.appendChild(container);
```
