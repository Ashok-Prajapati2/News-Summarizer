After sitting pretty on Greams Road for 19 years, the multi-designer boutique has now found comfort in a 70-year-old house in Nungambakkam. A melange of rich embroidery, solid patterns and skilful weaving adorns the new venue that is rich with anstyle. While the grand house with its lush garden gives one the feeling of stepping into a bygone era, the modern interior architecture instantly offers a contemporary feeling.\nLata Madhu\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial arrangement\nFor Lata, who founded this store along with her sister Priya Vasudevan, \"planning and then working\" has never been an option as she believes in just going with the flow. \"I never planned to choose this house in particular. I just saw and fell in love with it. Here, from every window you can see a tree, which I think adds up to the beauty of this place. I didn't even rework this house much. A lot of elements have been retained, like the ceiling and the floors. There is also a wall where the bricks are from the 50s. It just created a sort of wow factor,\" she says.\nA unique feature about this 4,000 square feet store is that every room has a different character. \"For instance, the rooms with travel clothes give a sense of relaxation. Another room showcases garments in cotton and chanderi. There is a room for Indian wear and one that features trendy brunch looks. We have always been good with curation. We don't like to be conclusive,\" adds Lata.\nDesigner collection at Collage\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial arrangement\nOver the years,aesthetics have evolved. “We initially started by being minimal, contemporary and stark. We would now like to be seen as a warmer, slower and experiential space,” she says.\nAs with clothes, Lata’s love for artisanal crafts seeps into decor as well. The store features metal furniture and crafts from Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. “I did not want furniture from a showroom. Except for the two Barcelona couches, every piece of furniture here is from Moradabad,” says Lata.\nApart from the clothes, art works by Sam Madhu, Chennai-born Berlin-based graphic artist and Lata's daughter, add colour to the space.\nCollage stocks the works of about 40 designers including well-established names such as Payal Khandwala, Sukhet Dhir, Amrich, Cell Design and Péro and new ones such as Itrh , Paisley Pop (Jewellery) , Inej, Maku and Dyelogue.\n“Almost all our designers work with pan India craftsmen, weavers and artisans,” says Lata, adding that Maku is involved with weavers and dyers from Bengal, 11 11 Cell Design works with craftsmen in Kutch, Payal Khandwala deals with women weavers, while Suket Dhir engages weavers from Benaras.\nArt by Sam Madhu\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial arrangement\n“Our thought process shifted during COVID-19, a deeper appreciation for textile, handmade clothing was what we were leaning towards. As everyday style over fashion and trends was already our core belief, now we wanted a sense of something more permanent, a little bygone and classical,” signs of Lata.\nCollage is located at6, Rutland Gate 4th street, Nungambakkam, Chennai.Prices start at ₹4,000.\n/\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

She is surrounded by designer wear, greenery, and a few other friends who share almond-eyed glances while clad in vibrant clothes.\nThe silence of an art gallery is recreated well at Collage, a multi-designer boutique housed in a 70-year-old Art Deco house in Nungambakkam. At the entrance, past the greenery and lounging cats, stand three framed pieces from Vaikuntam’s collection.\nSeeking Vaikuntam, a collaborative exhibition between Artworld Sarala’s Art Centre and Collage showcases pieces from Thota Vaikuntam’s collection over the last decade. These timeless art pieces are presented alongside contemporary luxury fashion from three brands — Amrich, 11.11, and Rasa\nThota Vaikuntam’s art at Collage\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\n“Thota Vaikuntam is a mascot for art from Telangana, so we thought this kind of fusion would be interesting to see how art influences fashion and fashion influences art,” says Anahita Banerjee, director of Artworld Sarala’s Art Centre.\nThese clothing brands were meticulously chosen to complement the art. Their ethos lies in organic, fair practices of fashion without the use of any chemicals. “We’re not an art gallery or a space where you come in exclusively for the art. So in parallel, we picked three fashion brands that employ hands for their work, like block printing, or shibori. We cheekily tried to bring in clothes of a similar colour palette because we did not want to dilute from the art,” says Lata Madhu, founder of Collage.\nThota Vaikuntam’s art at Collage\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\nCurating an art exhibition is an art in itself. Galleries around the world are often minimalistic and devoid of colour because the art is the main focus. “ It is the art that brings life to the space. I think the key is to not distract from the art, and we have tried to complement it with fashion,” she adds.\nThe oldest artwork on display is a 32-year-old rare frame of a lady in white. The piece belongs to Lata who bought it when she was only 22. “This is from the White series, which he is no longer painting. She brought so much colour into my life when I was in a sterile, lifeless apartment in the US,” she says, adding that her favourite part about Vaikuntam’s art is that he makes his women voluptuous, with relatable body types.\nSeeking Vaikuntam is on display at Collage, Rutland Gate, Nungambakkam until January 26 from 11am to 7pm.\n\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

This was for a class project. Little did she know then, that this would become her full time occupation. “My passionate career,” smiles Sushma.\nThe sculptor and ceramicist from Kochi was in Collage to display Earth Air Water Fire, a collaborative festival collection between her and the multi-brand luxury designer store..\n“Earlier this year Lata Madhu, the owner of Collage, and I got on a call. She wanted me to create something specially for Deepavali. So I came up with this,” says Sushma pointing to neatly arranged rows of lamps, where some even looks like Aladdin’s. There are three types of diyas of which two are the oil and wick variants and one is a tea light. Additionally, there are plates, serving trays, bowls, and dinnerware too in soothing shades of blue, green, ochre and purple, with shapes ranging from elegant square to circular with an edge..\nSushma also works with prints and other surface techniques on ceramics. The pieces can be customised and so can the colours. “Nowadays you can get any colour. We have stains in red, yellow, green…,” she says, adding that her clients have all sorts of requests from goldpadukasin clay, printed crockery to mural with swirls.\nOriginally from Chennai, Sushma first learnt the art of pottery under Toshikazu Kanai Yokohama, a Japanese trainer in Injambakkam, in 1996. She then trained at Golden Bridge Pottery in Auroville, followed by stints in Bengaluru. “Wherever there were courses being offered, I would apply,” she says.\nI love working with my hands, Sushma says. As a Fine Arts student from Stella Maris College, she says that her 2D art was not great. “For me, everything is three dimensional. I got into pottery immediately after I graduated.”\nShe moved to Kochi in 2006 and has been doing solo shows since. In 2012, she launched her studio Artmosphere in Thiruvaniyoor, on the outskirts of Kochi. The studio focusses on functional pottery and custom-made orders. That is her Zen space.\n“There is a certain romance to pottery when you sit for a class and enjoy it. But when there are deadlines where you have to complete orders for clients, it can get stressful.”\nBut what Sushma finds exciting about this medium is the fact that you can mould something and move it to your will. “You do have ups and downs working with clay. It has a mind if its own.”\nThe artist likes to experiment and create new pieces. Her inspiration comes from myriad sources. “If I am travelling for a show, it comes from the city I am showcasing in. For example, in Jaipur, I made kettles with handles in the shape of camels, andjaaliwork pattern on the tea pot. Textile designs, mango and floral motifs andkolamdesigns also find their way into creations whilst in Chennai” she says.\nSushma feels that people need to understand that since everything is handmade, it takes time to produce these pieces. “And there will be differences in lines or brush strokes. That’s the charm and beauty of handmade,” she says.\nCollage X Artmosphere is on display at Collage on Rutland Gate. Customised orders can also be placed. Prices start at ₹500 and go up to ₹17,000.\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

Siva Saravanan\nNagai Muralidharan and Nagai Sriram performed a violin duet on the fourth day of the seven-day Bharat Sangeet Utsav, held in Coimbatore. Their well-planned concert started with Thiruvotriyur Tyagayyar’s varnam, ‘Karunimpa,’ in Sahana. This was followed by ‘Sri Jaalandhara,’ a composition of Mysore Jaya Chamarajendra Wodeyar, in the majestic Gambira Nattai. Tyagaraja kritis ‘Pariyachakamaa’ (Vanaspathi) and ‘Nee Pogadakunte’ (Varali) preceded the delightful Khamas alapana and Mysore Vasudevachar’s ‘Brochevarevaru Ra’. The niraval and swarakalpana session was particularly enjoyable with intricately woven swara repartees. They concluded with Vyasaraja’s ‘Krishnaa Nee Begane’ and a soothing tillana composed by Maharajapuram Santhanam in Sivaranjani. Thanjavur Murugabhoopathi on the mridangam and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan on the ghatam showcased their mastery.\nN. Ravikiran began his chitravina recital with a rare kriti of Oothukkadu Venkatakavi on Ganesha, ‘Sindhiththavar Nenjil Iruppathu Sivaloka Ganapathiye’ in Nattai. He told the audience about the contribution of the poet’s indirect descendents, particularly Needamangalam Krishnamurthy Bhagavatar, who had preserved not only the compositions, but also the tunes. The delineation of Pantuvarali, (‘Enna Gaanu Raama Bhajana’ by Bhadrachala Ramadas) and the niraval for ‘Maarubalka Kunnavemi Raa’ by Tyagaraja in Sriranjani were highly enjoyable. ‘Raghuvamsa Sudhaambhudhi’ in Kathanakuthuhalam by Patnam Subramanya Iyer was presented in the vilamba kala in the beginning, enabling the rasikas to recall the lyrics and soak in their beauty. The brisk pace at the end showcased another facet of the composition.\nAt the festival, Ravikiran was the first musician to take up Ritigowla as the main raga. After a mesmerising alapana, he presented ‘Janani Ninnu Vina.’ This composition by Subbaraya Sastri, son and disciple of Syama Sastri, epitomised devotion and supplication. ‘Idathu Padham Thookki Aadum’ by Papanasam Sivan and a tillana in Kalyana Vasantham brought the concert to a close. Akkarai Subbulakshmi on the violin was at her best and followed her guru with utter sincerity. Mannargudi Eswaran on the mridangam and K.V. Gopalakrishnan on the ganjira enhanced the concert and gave a delightful thani.\nVidwans Nagai Muralidharan and Thanjavur Murugabhoopathy sat through Ravikiran’s concert, with evident enjoyment. ‘Tyagaraja Meets Ilaiyaraaja’ was a collaborative effort, featuring P. Ganesh on the chitravina, B. Vijayagopal on the flute and K. Satyanarayanan on the keyboard. All the artists were exponents of Carnatic music but they had one common love — the maestro’s music. The concert began on a formal note with the Tyagaraja Pancharatnam, ‘Jagadaananda Kaarakaa’ in Nattai and followed by ‘Pani Vizhum Malarvanam’ from the Tamil film,Ninaivellam Nithya. Those used to listening only to Carnatic music were pleasantly surprised when they discovered how close film songs were to the classical ragas — for instance, ‘Endhan Nenjil’ is in Nalinakanti and ‘Ennulle Ennulle’ in Kiravani. Then, the three main artists presented their favourites. Ganesh played Tyagaraja’s composition in Atana, ‘Anupama Gunaambhudhi,’ Vijayagopal rendered the sprightly ‘Ninnu Kori Varanam’ from the movieAgni Natchathiramand Satyanarayanan took the rasikas back to Tyagaraja with ‘Bhagaayanayya’ in Chandrajyothi. Film songs and Carnatic compositions followed each other. The audience could get immersed in the softness of ‘Idhazhil Kadhai Ezhuthum Neramidhu’ and soon sit up energetically with the spirited ‘Sarasa Saamadhaana.’\nHamsanadham got a special treatment with ‘Bantureeti’ as well as interludes from film songs. It was time for the main song. Flautist Vijayagopal began with the soothing Kalyani. Satya followed, and Ganesh soon joined them. After a spirited tanam, a few popular film songs in the same raga leapt out — ‘Vandhaal Mahalakshmiye,’ ‘Sundari Kannaal Oru Saedhi’ and ‘Vellai Puraa Ondru.’ Then, the music rose to a crescendo with Tyagaraja’s ‘Vaasudevayeni’.\nExpert percussionists K.V. Prasad (mridangam), K.V. Gopalakrishnan (ganjira) and V. Krishna Kishore (K.V. Prasad’s son) on the rhythm pad had a big role to play in the success of this novel effort. Their thani session was grand and Krishna Kishore made an additional impact by producing sounds of the ghatam, mathalam, morsing and drums out of his rhythm pad.\nSanjay Subrahmanyan’s inspired delineation of Khambodi and the much-loved composition, ‘Thiruvadi Charanam’ will remain etched in the minds of rasikas for long. He began with the Saveri varnam, ‘Sarasooda’ and presented ‘Sri Raghukula’ in Hamsadhwani, by Tyagaraja. The refreshing song, ‘Jaadhiyile, Madhangalile’, advised people to remain united in the path of sanmarga. ‘Vihara Maanasa Raame,’ a rarely-heard composition by Swati Tirunal took the main seat. A delectable depiction of Kapi preceded that. The niraval and swaraprastara session earned Sanjay thunderous applause.\nTamil songs ruled the lighter session. He rendered a few stanzas from Periyazhvar Thirumozhi, beginning with, ‘Vanna Maadangal Soozh Thirukkottiyur’ in ragamalika and moved on to a viruttam, ‘Maalon Maruganai’. ‘Vaa Vaa Vel Murugaa’ by Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri gave the concert a lilting finish.\nViolinist Nagai Muralidharan’s manodharma, mridangam player Thanjavur Murugabhoopathi’s mastery of laya and K.V. Gopalakrishnan’s pleasing ganjira added vitality to Sanjay’s performance.\n///\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

Shades of whites and creams form an intrinsic part ofsantha(peace) innavarasaseries.\n“Collage works demand a lot of patience as one has to pay attention to the smallest detail, keeping pace with one’s imagination. Selection of the paper plays an imperative part as it sets the tone of the artwork,” says Mr. Ramchand, who is pursuing MFA final year at AU.\nAfter inaugurating the show, consultant physician and artist Vempati Rama Narasimham said: “For artists, perception of art differs from a common man. However, what stands out is how an artist prefers to convey the message through his works.” The collage show that concludes on Monday will be open for visitors at the Department of Fine Arts from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Café Collage, a new restaurant at Poojappura, takes this quote quite literally, by offering a unique combination of exquisite art and appetising food for their customers.\n“Our motto is to provide a homely atmosphere to our customers, where they can taste their favourite delicacies while appreciating art forms which are on display,” says Remya Jayachandran, owner of the restaurant. “We have brought together some popular dishes from India, including a selection of mouth-watering delicacies from Kerala, which will be available throughout the day. Chinese dishes as well as sizzlers will be available in the evening,” she adds.\nThe restaurant is decorated like an old ‘tharavadu’ – complete with wooden furniture, along with exquisite paintings and bohemian sculptures. One can choose to purchase art work, as well. The sumptuous vegetarian lunch costs only Rs. 60, while the more elaborate course with fish curry would make you poorer by Rs. 90 only.\nVegetarians can choose from popular dishes like Gobi Masala, Paneer Butter Masala and Dal Fry among others. Non-vegetarians also have an elaborate fare, which includes Chicken Roast, Chicken Tempura and Boneless Chicken. If you are fond of short eats, the restaurant offers burgers, spring rolls and cutlets too, along with piping hot filter coffee. The ‘Kummattikka Juice’, a.k.a. watermelon juice, at Café Collage is all you need to beat the heat this summer!\nThere is an entire section of flavoursome sea food dishes like fish roll, seafood fried rice, seafood Schezwan fried rice, Schezwan noodles, grilled fish sizzler, tava fried fish…I ordered the quintessential Indo-Chinese delicacy: vegetable fried rice and chilli chicken. The rice, which was well-cooked and fluffy, bowled me over with its flavour. The curry was a bit on the spicier side. There were sufficient boneless chicken pieces both tender and succulent – leaving me too full for a dessert.\nLocated on the Poojappura-Thirumala road, near the Indian Bank, Cafe Collage is open from 11.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. Contact 9497348948\n/\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

But the celebrations are already underway: this includes an art show, a gamut of new collections, and old designers making a comeback.\n“From July onwards we are doing something interesting every month. We didn’t just want to invite people and do dinner. It had to be something unusual; something that’s got a strong design sense. There should be a design story to talk about,” says Lata Madhu, founder of the multi-designer store. To begin with, she got Aulerth to showcase its sustainable jewellery, while Pero launched its new collection including a line for men.\nCollage which first opened in 2004, on the corner of Greams Road, moved to a new address in 2022. A sprawling 70-year-old bungalow — flanked by tall trees and bathed in sunlight — on Rutland Gate. Lata wanted this space to have a soul, with craft at its core. And this is what she keeps in mind while curating collections.\nHolding up a brilliant pink tunic by Sartorial by Swati she traces her hand through the Manipuri embroidery work on it. “Swati is a textile designer from Mumbai and her forte is dyeing,” she adds, pulling out a kaftan with ombre dye. This is craft with a modern touch, shesays. The store is also bringing back Anand Kabra after almost eight years. “He used be one of our bestsellers. He was so experimental,” adds Lata. Studio Renn will showcase its jewellery, along with some pieces made specially for Collage, and Suket Dhir will be back with his creations and his talk series.\nSartorial on display at Collage\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\nIn its 20th year, Collage has new plans. Lata is keen to align the brand with any form of artistic expression, and be a part of the process. “The idea is also to showcase things that are not just clothing. We don’t just want to be a fashion destination,” she adds. As part of the celebrations, there is a digital art exhibition planned — Reincarnations:: Ghosts of a South Asian Past by Sam Madhu — on August 31, where the entire parking lot will transform into an art gallery.\nCuration, she says, is important. “It is what will set you apart. Understanding your city is very important. Each city’s mindset and pulse is very different,” she says.\nAt Collage, every room has a name and is curated keeping with the vibe of the space . “For example, the mango tree room has the smallest window, so the clothes there are mostly solids as there is not much natural light coming in and the verandah where we do most of our events has some form of drape kept there as it’s airy with light coming in,” she explains. There is the brick room that greets you as soon as you enter; it retains the original bricks from decades ago. We had to strip the walls to expose the bricks, she says. This is followed by the frangipani room overlooking the tree it’s named after, the Indian room, and the courtyard room.\nA collection by Pero\n| Photo Credit:\nSpecial Arrangement\n“Our curation is what people are talking about,” Lata smiles, while confessing that when she started out two decades ago she had no idea about racking. “I started because I had an opportunity and resources but I was not qualified. We opened a beautiful store and had big names like Raghavendra Rathore, Meera and Muzaffar Ali, Sabyasachi... There was no Instagram then. The business was achieved by the number of people who came,” she recalls. From housing the works of around 20 designers, the boutique now has 40 designers on display. “Some brands that started with us are still with us. People who shopped with me 20 years back still shop with me,” she says.\n//\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

They defeated Air India on Saturday,while narrowly emerging victorious over Sonnet Cricket Club in the GG Dutt Memorial final on Sunday.\nCoaching and managing the side to an unprecedented trophy double,Rajbir Singh became the first coach in Collage Sportss history to achieve this feat.\nIt was a hectic weekend to say the least,but my boys made me really proud, says Singh,unable to conceal his happiness.\nWhile the modern-day game has left most coaches gasping for breath in an attempt to keep pace with its constantly evolving nature,Singh likes keeping things simple.\nI prefer the traditional form of coaching. Player management plays the most important role in my book. I constantly keep my players motivation levels high. This is my greatest weapon. It is the secret to my success, he says.\nInnovating tooNot far behind though on innovating,Singh promoted Pradeep Sangwan up the order to open the innings. Sangwan,an upcoming prospect and a regular member of Delhi Daredevils squad in the,rose to the occasion immediately.\nHe batted beautifully in the semi-final where his 84 runs won us the match. I like to constantly innovate, he says,adding But we always keep it simple. There is no point in complicating things.\nHaving been with Collage Sports for the last 16 years,Singh believes things have changed radically in his tenure with the club. But he feels that his job will be well and truly done when his players make a bigger impression with the state and national selectors.\nHaving been league champions for two years in a row,Collage have also made inroads into ONGCs stronghold at the club level in the Capital.\nWe have won the double. We have defeated ONGC in six out of the last eight meetings. By winning the crucial tournaments,we are by far the club to reckon with here, he says.\nBut with no players in the Ranji camp bar Sangwan,Singh believes that the fruits of his labour are yet to be seen.\nThe selectors dont care about performances. They just care about money. I do hope that they see what our club has achieved. Only when my players make a national impact,which I believe they are capable of doing,will I be completely satisfied, concludes the winning coach.\nBrief scores: Sonnet Cricket Club 287/5 in 40 overs (Rahul Diwan 100,Yashpal Singh 76,Gaurav Kochar 58; Mahesh Rawat 1/33); Collage Sports 290/6 in 38.4 overs (Mahesh Rawat 96,Kamal Baniwal 74; Yashpal Singh 2/19)\n\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\nSubscriber Only\n\n"

Ramchand, who judged the collage competitio, displaying his recent collage work at the valedictory function on Friday.\nCollage is one aspect of art, which was introduced by the father of modern art Pablo Picasso, said noted artist and art teacher K. Ramchand, who participated as a judge at the collage competition held in connection with the Ozone Day on Friday.\nThe collage event, organised byThe Hinduin association with Essar Foundation at the Visakhapatnam Public Library, drew participation from 60 students of various schools.\nMr. Ramchand displayed a collage of silver medal winner from India in the Rio Olympics P.V. Sindhu, which he had made after she won the medal.\nThe colourful collage drew applause from the gathering. He said his idea was to motivate the students to take up the art.\n“Spontaneity is the hallmark of an artist and collage is an excellent form to express certain issues and ideas. My work entitled ‘Rajatha Sindhuram’ is a tribute to the girl, who brought honours to the country,” he told the students.\nStressing on the importance of participating in competitions, irrespective of winning a prize or not, Mr. Ramchand said: “participation in a competition is not a small thing. Only 10 out of 100 students participate and that itself gives them the winning edge. Though only three or five participants are only chosen winners as there is a restriction on the number.”\nKranthi Swaroop Y (AP Social Welfare Residential School, Centre of Excellence), Sowmyasri P (Fort Catholic Girls’ High School), P. Harsha Vardhini (Fort Catholic) bagged the first, second and third prizes respectively.\nThe consolation prizes went to P. Kathyayani (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan) and A. Durga Prasad (Sri Sarada Vidyalayam).\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.
