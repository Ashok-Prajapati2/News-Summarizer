            "content": "Updated- September 07, 2024 12:08 am IST\nUS Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaking on March 26, 2024, in Raleigh, North Carolina; and former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024\n| Photo Credit: AFP\nThe battle lines for the U.S. presidential elections were drawn when Vice President Kamala Harris and Governoras the Democratic Party’s nominees for President and Vice President, respectively. They will face the Republican Party’s nominees, former President Donald Trump and his. As of now, according to opinion polls, Ms. Harris has a three-plus point lead on average over Mr. Trump.\nAlso read:\nIn the U.S., it is not enough for the candidate to win the popular vote in percentage terms. They have to win the electoral college, a group of presidential electors from each State whose number is determined by the population of the State. The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the candidate requires a majority of 270 votes to become President. Large States such as California, Texas, New York, and Florida, for example, provide 55, 38, 29, and 29 electoral college votes each.\nIn this first article of a series of articles on the U.S. elections, we will look at ‘battleground States’ or ‘swing States’.\nAlso read:\nThe maps show how each State voted in elections since 2000. States that were won by the two parties by more than 5% points are marked (red for Republican and blue for Democrats). The larger the difference in vote shares between the parties, the deeper the shades of colours (dark red for more Republican votes and dark blue for more Democrat votes).\nChart appears incomplete?to remove AMP mode\nSince 2016, when Mr. Trump made his electoral foray, the starkness in the support base of the two parties has been more pronounced than ever before. States that are largely rural, have a substantial number of religiously minded voters, are less racially diverse, and have a large white-working class population tend to vote Republican, while Democrats receive substantive support from States with a significant urban population, a diverse demography, and a considerable number of college-educated voters.\nThere are some States with a mix of urban and rural voters and a diverse demography; these are the swing States where there is intense competition between the two parties. Some swing States, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, are from the ‘Rust Belt’ — i.e., they were industrialised but have seen industrial decline and relative urban decay since. Some others, such as Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina in the south-east and Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico in the west/south-west, are from the ‘Sun Belt’ — i.e., they have a warm climate. Swing States are marked with a yellowish tinge. Since 2016, these States have moved decisively towards the Republican Party.\nMs. Harris and Mr. Trump need victories in a definite combination of swing States in the two Belts to win elections. If the swing States are not included and the two parties’ strongholds are expected to vote for them, the Democrats and Republicans would have 221 and 189 electoral votes, respectively.\nThe opinion polls show a close race in the swing States (Table 1). If the polling averages hold true in these States, the electoral college votes would break 292-246 in favour of the Democrats. But the margins between the two parties are very close. If one of the Rust Belt States (say, Pennsylvania) and one of the Sun Belt States (say, Georgia) provide more votes to Mr. Trump than Ms. Harris, the electoral numbers would be 281-257 in favour of the Republicans.\nThe table shows the latest polling averages for Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump in the swing States (as of August 31)\nAs the election gets closer, the two parties will focus on campaigning in these States. In forthcoming articles, we will look into the two parties’ support bases and how they have changed over time.\nSource: Nate Silver’s substack, historical electoral data from various sources\nAlso read:\nPublished- September 05, 2024 08:04 am IST\n//\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

            "content": "Updated- September 12, 2024 04:58 pm IST\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed a brain-inspired analog computing platform capable of storing and processing data in an astonishing 16,500 conductance states within a molecular film. Published on September 11 in the journal Nature, this breakthrough represents a step forward over traditional digital computers in which data storage and processing are limited to just two states, the IISc said.\nIn a press release, the institute said that such a platform could potentially bring complex AI tasks, like training Large Language Models (LLMs), to personal devices like laptops and smartphones, thus taking us closer to democratising the development of AI tools. These developments are currently restricted to resource-heavy data centres, due to a lack of energy-efficient hardware. With silicon electronics nearing saturation, designing brain-inspired accelerators that can work alongside silicon chips to deliver faster, more efficient AI is also becoming crucial.\n“Neuromorphic computing has had its fair share of unsolved challenges for over a decade,” explained Sreetosh Goswami, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), IISc, who led the research team. “With this discovery, we have almost nailed the perfect system – a rare feat,\" he said.\nAccording to IISc, the fundamental operation underlying most AI algorithms is quite basic – matrix multiplication, a concept taught in high school maths. But in digital computers, these calculations hog a lot of energy. The platform developed by the IISc team drastically cuts down both the time and energy involved, making these calculations a lot faster and easier.\nThe molecular system at the heart of the platform was designed by Sreebrata Goswami, Visiting Professor at CeNSE. As molecules and ions wiggle and move within a material film, they create countless unique memory states, many of which have been inaccessible so far. Most digital devices are only able to access two states (high and low conductance), without being able to tap into the infinite number of intermediate states possible.\nBy using precisely timed voltage pulses, the IISc team found a way to effectively trace a much larger number of molecular movements, and map each of these to a distinct electrical signal, forming an extensive “molecular diary” of different states. “This project brought together the precision of electrical engineering with the creativity of chemistry, letting us control molecular kinetics very precisely inside an electronic circuit powered by nanosecond voltage pulses,” explained Goswami.\n\"Tapping into these tiny molecular changes allowed the team to create a highly precise and efficient neuromorphic accelerator, which can store and process data within the same location, similar to the human brain. Such accelerators can be seamlessly integrated with silicon circuits to boost their performance and energy efficiency,\" the IISc said.\nIISc researchers said the key challenge that the team faced was characterising the various conductance states, which proved impossible using existing equipment. The team designed a custom circuit board that could measure voltages as tiny as a millionth of a volt, to pinpoint these individual states with unprecedented accuracy.\nIt also turned this scientific discovery into a technological feat. The team was able to recreate NASA’s iconic “Pillars of Creation” image from the James Webb Space Telescope data – originally created by a supercomputer – using just a tabletop computer. They were also able to do this at a fraction of the time and energy that traditional computers would need.\nUsing their AI accelerator, the team recreated NASA’s iconic “Pillars of Creation” image from the James Webb Space Telescope data on a tabletop computer – achieving this in a fraction of the time and energy required by traditional systems, it said.\nThe team includes several students and research fellows at IISc. They also collaborated with Stanley Williams, Professor at Texas A&M University and Damien Thompson, Professor at the University of Limerick, it added.\nThe researchers believe that this breakthrough could be one of India’s biggest leaps in AI hardware, putting the country on the map of global technology innovation. Navakanta Bhat, Professor at CeNSE and an expert in silicon electronics led the circuit and system design in this project. “What stands out is how we have transformed complex physics and chemistry understanding into groundbreaking technology for AI hardware,” Goswami explained.\n“In the context of the India Semiconductor Mission, this development could be a game-changer, revolutionising industrial, consumer and strategic applications. The national importance of such research cannot be overstated,\" he said.\nWith support from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the IISc team is now focused on developing a fully indigenous integrated neuromorphic chip. “This is a completely home-grown effort, from materials to circuits and systems,” he emphasised.\n“We are well on our way to translating this technology into a system-on-a-chip,\" he added.\nPublished- September 12, 2024 03:57 pm IST\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

The dollar slipped after data showed U.S. private employers hired the fewest number of workers in 3-1/2 years in August, while separate data showed services sector activity was steady in August. MSCI's index for Latin American currencies rose 0.2%, while a gauge for stocks gained 0.3%. Investors globally have been cautious this week on signs of slowing growth in U.S. economy, while some uncertainty remains over how much the Federal Reserve could ease policy at its Sept. 17-18 meeting. The release on Friday of the U.S. employment report for August could be key in gauging the size of the potential rate cuts ahead of inflation data later this month. Market bets still favor a 25-basis-point rate cut at the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee's meeting in two weeks, with a roughly 40% chance of a 50-basis-point move, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. \"A rate reduction at the FOMC's upcoming meeting on September 18 looks all but certain, but the upcoming CPI report could serve as a tiebreaker between a 25- or 50-bp cut if the August jobs report lands in the gray zone between clearly weak and clearly strong,\" Wells Fargo analysts wrote in a note. Lower U.S. interest rates typically benefit higher-yielding, but riskier emerging market assets and would help relieve pressure on weakening currencies in Latin America. Brazil's real led gains in the region, adding 1.1% against the dollar in its best day in nearly two weeks. A Brazilian central bank official said policymakers have taken note of the country's stronger economic growth and currency since their last policy meeting. Meanwhile, Mexico's peso slipped 0.1% to 19.9431 after briefly touching the 20-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a month, as jitters persisted after the lower house of Congress approved an overhaul of the country's judiciary early on Wednesday. Colombia's peso appreciated 0.5%, while Chile's peso was flat. A Reuters poll of FX strategists showed Brazil's real will continue to be restrained by worries about the country's fiscal situation in the near future, while most respondents saw risks for the Mexican peso tilted to the downside. Local stock exchanges were broadly higher, with Brazil's Bovespa up 0.3%. Mexican stocks lost 0.2%. Mexico's bank regulator approved the terms of a stock market reform that was passed last year, which could loosen regulations for companies to go public, speed up the process and reduce the costs involved. Ghana launched a restructuring agreement for roughly $13 billion of its international bonds.
