As the day approaches, here’s all you need to know.\nThe history of Hindi Diwas dates back to the early days of the Indian independence movement. In 1918, a group of Hindi scholars and activists formed the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan (Hindi Literary Conference) to promote the use of Hindi as a national language.\nThe Sammelan played a major role in the adoption of Hindi as the official language of India. After independence, the Constituent Assembly of India accepted Hindi, written in Devanagari script, as an official language onSeptember 14, 1949.\nThis decision was taken to promote and develop Hindi as thelingua francaof India and to unite the diverse linguistic and cultural regions of the nation. The first Hindi Diwas was celebrated in 1953.\nHindi Diwas, also known as National Hindi Day, is celebrated annually to commemorate the adoption of Hindi as one of the official languages of India. In 2024, it will be falling onSaturday, September 14.\nWhile the Constitution of India does not give any language the status of national language, Hindi in Devanagari script is the official language of the central government and the Union as per Article 343.\naims to raise awareness about the language and also commemorate the event when it was adopted as one of the official languages of India.\nThe adoption of Hindi as an official language was aimed at simplifying administration in a nation with multiple languages.

The Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (KaRaVe) has decided to celebrateto counter it, along with a protest across the State on September 14. ‘Tithi’ in Kannada refers to a ritual associated with death of a person.\nAs September 14 is a holiday on account of being a second Saturday, the ‘Hindi Herike Virodhi Karnataka’ (Anti-Hindi Imposition Karnataka) staged a protest in front of the State Bank of India head office on Kempegowda Road in Bengaluru on September 13.\nCelebration of Hindi Diwas on September 14 is mandatory in all Union Government-owned banks, departments like railways, postal, income tax, Central Universities, schools and other departments, including public sector companies in Karnataka. Various programmes have been planned on the day.\nAlso read:\nAs part of the ‘Hindi Fortnight 2024’ celebrations, the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) has decided to conduct various competitions in Hindi for its employees and staff whose mother tongue is other than Hindi from September 14 to 28. The Registrar of NIMHANS has issued a circular in this regard.\n“Union Government has been trying to impose Hindi on non-Hindi speaking States in the name of celebrating Hindi Diwas. Imposition of Hindi is threatening the unity and integrity of the country. It is imperative to hold a massive protest against the imposition of Hindi, which is breaking the country,” said T. A. Narayana Gowda from KaRaVe.\nAnother faction of KaRaVe, headed by Shivaramegowda, has decided to celebrate ‘Hindi Tithi Divas’ in all the district headquarters on September 14.\nOn September 13, film producer S.R. Govindu and KSRTC Kannada Kriya Samiti president Va.Cha.Channegowda were among the participants in the protest organised by ‘Hindi Herike Virodhi Karnataka’ in front of the State Bank of India head office.\n“It is seen that the use of Kannada language is not given priority while conducting business transactions in banks, post offices, insurance offices within the geographical area of ​​Karnataka State. Also, Hindi language is forced on Kannadigas in banks, post offices, life insurance offices. Dissatisfaction is growing among the public about the systematic imposition of Hindi in the State. Karnataka is a member State of the Union of Federal Republic of India with its own language, culture, history and heritage. The Constitution of India has ensured the protection and development of our language. Even so, the sentiments of crores of Kannadigas in Karnataka are being hurt by systematic neglect of not using Kannada in public institutions,” alleged Parvathish Bilidale, Convenor of the organisation.\n* The Union Government should immediately amend the Constitution and make all the 22 languages ​​mentioned in the 8 schedule, as official and administrative languages, ​​and thereby preserve the sovereignty of this country. Articles 343 to 351 of the Constitution, which unjustly give special recognition to Hindi, should be repealed, and all languages ​​should be declared equal.\n* Kannada should be the official language in all Union Government departments and industries operating in Karnataka. All correspondence should be conducted in Kannada. Inter-State transactions and transactions with the Union government should also be conducted in Kannada.\n* Bilingual formula should be implemented instead of tri-lingual formula in Karnataka. Mandatory learning of Hindi should end from our school curriculum.\n* No correspondence, application forms, challans, digital boards, nameplates, ATM machines, announcements, SMS messages, public announcements in Karnataka shall use Hindi language. Kannada must be used in all these sections.\n* Those who do not know Kannada language are not allowed to work in Karnataka branches.\n* Activities which are harmful to the existence of Kannada language, like celebration of Hindi Diwas and encouragement to learn Hindi, should not continue in Karnataka.\n* A separate recruitment rule should be formulated to fill up the jobs created in the geographical area of ​​Karnataka, and recruitment should be made by making Kannada compulsory in written tests.\n* The process of merging the banks established by the people of Karnataka with the banks of north India should be stopped. Merger of State Bank of Mysore, Syndicate Bank, Vijaya Bank should be withdrawn, and returned to Kannadigas.\nPublished- September 13, 2024 04:23 pm IST\n/\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

He emphasised that the future belonged to Indian languages, and that the country could no longer be bound by colonial chains. Mr. Shah said that he had made sure all the files in the Ministry of Home Affairs were in Hindi.\n“I want to tell all Central government employees that it took three years for even a person like me to receive all the files in Hindi. None of the communication and files are in English in my Ministries (Home and Cooperation), all files are in Hindi,” Mr. Shah said, speaking at the Akhil Bharatiya Rajbhasha Sammelan to commemorate the 75th year of Hindi as the official language of the Union.\nThe Minister added that Hindi was not in competition with other Indian languages.\nMr. Shah inaugurated the Bharatiya Bhasha Anubhag (BBA) or the Indian languages section. He said that if any article, speech or letter was in Hindi, then the BBA would translate it into all the languages of the country.\nALSO READ:\n“Similarly, literature, articles and speeches of all the languages of the country will be translated into Hindi, which is the need of the hour,” Mr. Shah said.\nHe added that Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand had made the entire medical education curriculum available in Hindi. “In the coming days, the language of research will also definitely be Hindi,” Mr. Shah said.\nThe event was attended by poets, scholars and eminent authors from across the country.\nWith Mr. Shah on the dais, a Hindi scholar, Hariom Panwar, said that if there had to be a revolution in promoting and publicising Hindi, then it should begin at the Supreme Court.\n“I have been a professor of law for 40 years.... Supreme Court judges should start narrating their judgments in Hindi. As witnessed in the past 75 years, our advocates cannot argue in the court in Hindi. Only the English version of the Constitution is accepted in the court, not Hindi,” Mr. Panwar said.\n“When Taliban claimed Afghanistan on August 15, 2021, they said their next target is Jammu and Kashmir. Listen Taliban, you dance or forge enmity or friendship but in your own country. Stop dreaming about Kashmir and creating trouble by piggybacking on Pakistan. If Talibaniabba(father) andchacha(uncle) come here, they will be buried in the sea like Osama bin Laden. We will crush terrorism in Kashmir. We will make the infiltrators who throw bombs in the Valley meet 72hoors(angels) in heaven. Peace cannot be an answer to bullets, non-violence cannot be offered to murderers,” Mr. Panwar said.\n“Gandhi, Lincoln, Buddha are lying at the feet of extremists,” his rendition mentioned, and “India had stopped being part of piecemeal agreements”.\n“This is a transformation post-2014. On some issues, we have stopped being Bapu-Gandhi. Teach this to the land, the sea and the sky. Now, India cannot be divided and Kashmir will not be the property of anyone’sabba(father). This is new India. We removed Article 370; we removed the snake around our neck. We avenged Pulwama with Balakot. Rawalpindi has nightmares about Balakot. We have alienated diplomacy from fear as a lion sits on the throne in Delhi. The Indian Parliament has said Pakistan Occupied Kashmir is ours; it is about to come back to us,” Mr. Pawar said, amid huge applause from the audience.\nSuryaprakash Dixit, former head of the Department of Hindi, Lucknow University, demanded a separate Ministry for Indian languages as many languages were becoming extinct.\n“It was decided 60 years ago that all States should accept Hindi voluntarily for official work. Time has come to implement this. Southern States need to be assured that Hindi is not being forced on them, and people often feel today that if there had been a common language, then India would have gained victory in 1857. As per a conspiracy, Urdu and Hindi have been divided; both languages are related. There are common words in Hindi, Tamil and Bengali. Hindi’s acceptance should increase,” Mr. Dixit said.\nPublished- September 14, 2024 06:00 pm IST\n/\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

File\n| Photo Credit: PTI\nUnion Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday (September 14, 2024) said there is no competition between the official language Hindi and other Indian languages rather they are friends and complement each other.\nExtending greetings on the occasion of Hindi Diwas, Shah also said that it was the spirit of the Constituent Assembly that all citizens of the country should communicate with each other in an Indian language, be it Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam or Gujarati.\n“By strengthening Hindi, all these languages will also become flexible and prosperous and with the practice of integration, all languages will also take forward our culture, history, literature, grammar and the ‘sanskar’,” he said in a video message.\nThe Home Minister said the Hindi Diwas this year is very important for everyone because on September 14, 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India accepted Hindi as the official language of the Union.\nHe said it has been 75 years since then and the country is going to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of the official language this year.\n“Hindi has seen many ups and downs in 75 years but at this juncture, I can definitely say that Hindi has no competition with any local language. Hindi is a friend (sakhi) of all Indian languages and they complement each other. Whether it is Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil or Bangla, every language strengthens Hindi and Hindi strengthens every language,” he said.\nMr. Shah said if the Hindi movement is looked at carefully whether it is Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lala Lajpat Rai, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose or Acharya J B Kriplani, all of them hailed from non-Hindi speaking areas.\nHe said the committee formed under the leadership of N Gopalaswamy Ayyangar and K M Munshi had presented a report to the Constituent Assembly to recognise Hindi as the official language and give strength to Hindi and all our other languages.\n“Both these leaders also hailed from non-Hindi speaking areas,” he said.\nThe Home Minister said under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a lot of work has been done to strengthen Hindi and local languages in the last 10 years.\n“Modi ji has proudly addressed many international forums in Hindi and has put forward the importance of Hindi not only in the country but across the world. Along with this, the Prime Minister has also increased the sense of pride towards the country’s languages. In these 10 years, we have made a lot of efforts to strengthen several Indian languages,” he said.\nMr. Shah said Prime Minister Modi has given a new life to Hindi and all Indian languages by giving an important place to imparting primary education in mother tongue in the new education policy.\nMr. Shah said the government has developed a tool ‘Kanthasth’ in these 10 years.\n“We have submitted four reports of the Parliamentary Official Language Committee in the last 10 years and work has been done to establish Hindi prominently in government work,” he said.\nMr. Shah said the department of official language is also bringing a portal for translation from Hindi to all the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule through which any letter or speech could be translated into all languages in a very short time using Artificial Intelligence.\nThe Home Minister said this will greatly strengthen Hindi and local languages.\n“Our languages are among the richest languages of the world. Hindi connects us and all our languages,” he said.\nMr. Shah appealed to all the countrymen to take a pledge on the Hindi Diwas to strengthen Hindi and local languages and support this work of the department of official language.\nPublished- September 14, 2024 09:28 am IST\n/\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

            "content": "Trigger warning.“You didn’t mention you had a boyfriend of so many years?” said the man on the other end of the phone. It was around 3.30 am on an outdoor Hindi film shoot, long after the cast and crew had wrapped the night, eating and laughing together. The actor was stumped getting the call from one of the producers on the show. She politely told him it wasn’t the right time and hung up. He kept calling. She put her device on silent. Then, the phone in the room started ringing. “You didn’t answer my question?” the man persisted.\nThe actor, who had featured in a surprise hit film a few years ago, panicked when she realised her room was on the same floor as his and all the other actors were at least two floors below. Then in about ten minutes, the doorbell rang. “I freaked out completely. Then there were knocks for about a good 30 minutes and then he finally stopped. I was shocked because he looked the safest,” the actor toldabout her ordeal. The incident took place in early 2020, two years after the conversation around women’s safety was at its peak during the #MeToo movement.\nFollowing the explosive, which provided a damning indictment of the discrimination and exploitation faced by, there have been renewed discussions around the safety of women on film sets across movie industries. Bollywood, specifically, had its watershed moment in 2018 when many influential names were called out during the #MeToo movement, causing many to hope that the rotten system would finally be cleansed.\nOver the last two weeks,spoke to several women in the industry — actors, producers, assistants, those relatively safe due to family privilege, and the vulnerable outsiders — to find out if Hindi film sets have become a safer workspace and to point out possible solutions to ensure it remains a place that births dream, not nightmares.\nWhen popular names from the Hindi film industry were shamed for their inappropriate behavior — six years before the Hema Committee Report went public and created a domino effect — film sets were clouded with a “fear factor”. A film executive — who has worked across writers’ rooms and multiple films sets post #MeToo — says people are no more “blatant”.\n“There is an atmosphere of fear. Nobody is worried about going to jail, it’s purely the reputational damage that stings,” the source shared.However, the men in power positions, who were previously called out are back to work. So many others, who would “mess up” a lot and were hired on a project basis, were not in any power position and have now receded. “They think this is a sure-shot way of not being employed. The ones who were lower on the food chain have been impacted more,” the film executive added.\nA popular actor, who shot to fame with a major OTT show a few years ago, shared that she often hears casting directors say they have now installed CCTV cameras inside their office cabins. “It’s said as a joke like they are the victims, but the fear is palpable.”\nThis sentiment resonated across the board — horror stories one would hear often have now reduced, but not that harassers don’t have a way. An actor, known for her acclaimed roles on OTT, shared how the awareness has come in, but the power game is still on.\n“The powerful men have become smarter, so they say, ‘I have a good role for you, a great project so why don’t we meet?’ It starts like that and a woman always gets a hunch. The power play is so much that it will take a lot of courage. Big actresses have not come out in the open with what they have gone through, so how do you expect a small assistant to do that?”\n‘Can’t be just friendly’\nThe actor, who was subjected to harassment by one of the producers on the show, said the incident reaffirmed how difficult it is for women in the workspace to be friendly.\n“When you are shooting for long hours and days, of course you become friends but people misinterpret that as you liking them or being willing. You can’t be overfamiliar and have to be always on guard. Having realised the importance of having a staff and a bodyguard, I started tweaking my contracts after that for outdoor shoots,” she added.\nAn actor, who has been a prominent face across films and OTT shows, recalled how a co-star had once “misunderstood” her intentions when she was sitting with him in her room.\n“He was not a friend, but I had bumped into him. It was hot so we were chilling in the room and then he suddenly started to play with my hair. I froze because it was so strange. After a few minutes I turned around and said, ‘Dude what are you doing?’ That’s what made me realise what it means when women freeze in a moment. The starting point should be to have an organisation that monitors this– if not present all the time on set like an ambulance– to at least have a contact point,” she shared.\nThere is also the issue of “networking” which goes into dangerous territory, as women often have to meet men for work, who are ill-intentioned. A TV actor, who has been working in the industry for the past four years, shared how “powerful” men in the business will meet an actress for work but will be more interested in turning it into a date. The questions are personal, never professional, and the clincher is always this: Do you drink?\n“If you say yes, the meeting will be followed by drinks where it gets deeply uncomfortable,” the TV actor shared. Such meetings, the young artiste added, leave outsiders vulnerable as they think there is no other option but to keep the men happy and to remain in their good books. I have come home crying several nights, not sure if what I did was right or wrong. When you say no to someone, you wonder if it will harm your career. It becomes tougher when you are new with no power,” she added.\n‘No place for bad behaviour’\nThe incident involving knocking and insistent phone calls was not one off. Most of the female actorsspoke to revealed they all had “heard” such stories, even if not they weren’t at the receiving end. The actor, who was subjected to the disturbing episode, shared how she had informed the team about the man’s behaviour, after which he was ousted from the sets immediately.\n“He was never seen after that,” she sighed. The film executive said what happens on set, broadly speaking, depends on who is leading it. “It flows top down. If you have a temperamental, slightly oppressive, unpredictable director, who is snapping at various departments, that attitude is passed down.”\nThe executive was privy to at least two instances on film sets recently where someone was “badly behaved” and was thrown out promptly the next day. An actor, who has worked in films and some of the most popular OTT shows, revealed that she was instantly at ease on the shoot of an Emmay Entertainment project, when she learnt that the call sheet had a number for sexual harassment, wherein one could be anonymous and register any workplace complaint. The production house is founded by Nikkhil Advani, Monisha Advani and Madhu Bhojwani.\n“That was very progressive for a production to do it. Such moves are important because there is a third party looking into it,” she added. Whenreached out to Emmay Entertainment, they acknowledged the practice and stated that they uphold “a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual misconduct in any form, prioritizing the safety, health, and well-being of all individuals, especially women, within our organization.”\n“While policies are important, we believe creating a truly safe and inclusive work environment requires nurturing a culture of mutual trust, respect, and professionalism. To further this goal, we are committed to implementing industry best practices specifically designed to ensure women’s safety, both in the workplace and beyond. By fostering a supportive environment and adhering to these standards, we ensure that every person at Emmay feels protected, valued, and empowered,” producers Monisha Advani and Madhu Bhojwani said.\n‘Under the garb of intimate scenes…’\nA disturbing trend, which at least two actors shared with Indianexpress.com, was abouton sets. While many said it has now more or less become an “industry norm” to have an intimacy director on board for big banner films, things are murky when it comes to smaller, independent films.\nAn actor, who spoke to Indianexpress.com anonymously, was coming from a shoot where “a lot of hours” were spent filming an intimate scene which left her feeling “heavy in the head”.\n“A lot of times in the name of art, intimate and sexual scenes are shot. It is part of their ‘art’ but it is dangerous because they take out their sexual frustration through that. In the contract it is mentioned that there will be nudity, but it will be done ‘artistically.’ This happens in those semi-decent projects, where the director will tell you, ‘We won’t use this in the final edit,’ so why would you shoot it?\n“They change the shot taking of these intimate scenes, and it is twisted. It is disgusting because you are suddenly in a spot and can only voice it if you have some power, or if you are not too vulnerable. Because in that moment if you register your displeasure, you are the troublemaker who is not understanding ‘art.'”\nThe actor said Hindi film or OTT sets do not always have an intimacy coach, acting coach or a therapist on set. Especially for heavy duty projects or scenes, the production “must hire a therapist,” she said.\nIntimate scenes can be risky if the team is not well behaved, shared another actor. She recalled how there was an intimate scene to be shot for a project, where her co-actor was insistent that both of them should “bond” so that there is chemistry. It was an outdoor shoot, she was new to films, and hence, slightly low on confidence.\n“In the garb of ‘rehearsing’ and bonding, I figured he was taking advantage. I stopped him and said we will do all the rehearsals in front of the director, because there should be someone to see us and tell us if we are doing it right. In such intimate situations, you never know who is being exploitative, it can be your co-actor or the director himself.”\n‘Scandalous outdoors’\nEvery female actor and crew member Indian Express spoke to share how outdoor shoots are the “riskiest” for women, as most horror stories emerge from there. An acclaimed filmmaker, who has been in the industry for close to two decades, said long outdoor shoots are a menace.\n“I was shooting in London once, where a British girl informed me how she had worked with more than 15 international productions, but the most misbehaved men are on Indian crews. They have certain judgments about white women sleeping around, so they think the white women crew will be easily approachable. Here, women feel more vulnerable, so they do need their team or safe space around.”\nWhile long outdoor shoots are common in Hindi films, that’s not the case for TV. The TV actor Indianexpress.com spoke to said how when shows do go for outdoor schedules, it is no different than a Bollywood set. “It always happens. In Kashmir when a schedule was wrapped, the crew had a party and then later the director insisted my actor friend drink with him in his room. It had become a situation, because he wasn’t taking a no for an answer.”\n‘They are not looked at as good enough’\nA film set, like most workplaces, works on hierarchy and unfortunately that also dictates whose complaint will be taken more seriously. If an individual, purely by their standing in the hierarchy, is not considered important enough, then their complaint will also not be considered important. Those who suffer the most here are women with less power.\n“I was on a set on a smaller production. There was one vanity van, which was given to me and there were just six women on set,” recalled an actor. “There was no washroom for them. The men could pee outside, but those six women were clearly not considered important to be given a separate space. I asked the women to use my washroom and blasted the executive producer. Giving me a big van is not a sign of respect when the other girls on sets are ignored.”\nThe ordeal continued even in accommodation, as the said actor was put up in a good hotel, while the girls were staying in a motel which was “giving them the creeps because of the staff.” The issue was sorted out only when they approached the actor, who said how most film sets view hygiene and accommodation from a male point of view.\nThe male gaze is also what comes heavily into play on a film set, where women with no power are often. A female actor, who has headlined women-oriented stories, shared how she was on a set once where a sequence involved background dancers, who were in skimpy clothes.\n“When the song stopped, the actress was immediately covered. But the girls didn’t get the same treatment, till the next shot was set up. That clearly shows the difference.”\nThe film executive shared that though there are cases of lack of vanity vans and washrooms for women on sets, a better production will also take care of the crew. “We have Honey Wagons, which are portable gender-neutral washrooms. These are for areas which are hard to access, like if you are in a lake, hilltop, jungle then that is used. So, there is no excuse.”\nThe acclaimed filmmaker said where one stands on the hierarchy indirectly relates to who they will be in possible danger with. An assistant will most likely be vulnerable to harassment from other assistants or HODs. If one becomes an HOD, the filmmaker shared, they are then under the line of the director, producer or actors.\n“It is quite sad. But it all does come down to hierarchy. When I was an assistant art director, there was a DOP who would openly make sexual comments. I was only 21, and this happened when other assistants were around. I had no leverage on a DOP, so you can’t go to a producer or a director to complain. You need a sensitive crew here, who will take a stand.\n“Because a dominant problem of the industry is that women working here are seen as ‘easy’ or frivolous, someone who will be ready to sleep with anyone or will have multiple partners. This is what men outside and even inside the industry think of a woman, which ultimately reduces them to just objects.”\n‘More women, please’\nThough the general environment on film sets may largely feel friendly, respectful, and mindful of women workers, industry insiders said there is still a long, long way to go when it comes to an equal number of women on a movie set. As of now, an average set comprises 15 percent women and 85 percent men. In the best-case scenario, it is 20-25 percent of women.\nAll the stakeholders who spoke to the publication shared that having a minimum number of women in the crew should be mandated by the unions for a healthier, inclusive environment.\nA production executive associated with a prominent production house shared how it must be mandatory to have a POSH compliance for every project. The production executive said at their firm, they encourage women HODs so that the change reflects from top down.\n“Sh** show happens in all possible ways as one cannot take adults and treat them like children, however, once the entire team knows that the production house is mindful and is taking measures to prevent such situations, the overall vibe changes. Having a senior woman who is approachable makes a huge difference.”\nAn actor, who worked on a project led by a female director, noted how women HODs do end up playing a huge part in the safety on movie sets. “These conversations need to happen within teams right at the beginning to create a safe space. If there are women in powerful roles, that will also lead to change. If there is a lesser number of girls on a set and if a problem arises, they are bound to feel cornered.\n“So if a department is in place to look after your safety in case something happens, the next step should be to ensure that they are implemented. Every person in the chain has to be good, only then there can be change,” she noted.\nClick for more updates and latestalong with.

It is completing its 75th year and we are going to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of the official language this year. Hindi has been very important for the official language and for the languages ​​of all our states.”\nAlso Read:\nShah said, “Hindi has seen many ups and downs. But today, I can say with certainty that there is no competition between Hindi and any local language. Hindi is a friend of all the local languages. Whether it is Gujarati, Marathi or Telugu, every language gives strength to Hindi and Hindi gives strength to every language.”\nShah further noted “In the last 10 years, a lot of work has been done under the leadership of PM Modi to strengthen Hindi and local languages. PM Modi has put forth the importance of Hindi in front of the world by giving speeches inon many international forums and has also increased the interest towards our languages ​​in our country. In the coming days, the Department of Official Language is also bringing a portal for translation from Hindi to all the languages ​​of the Eighth Schedule, through which, whether it is a letter or a speech, we will be able to translate it into all languages ​​in a very short time using Artificial Intelligence.”\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi extended greetings to the people on the occasion of Hindi Diwas.\n\"Many best wishes to all the countrymen on Hindi Diwas,\" PM Modi posted on X.\nOn September 14, 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted Hindi in the Devanagari script as the official language of India.

            "content": "Amid a content drought in the Hindi-speaking belt, small-scale Tamil films, such asThangalaanandDemonte Colony 2,are stepping in to fill the void. These niche movies, which premiered weeks ago in their home states, are only arriving in the north now, deviating from the usual pan-India release pattern.\nHowever, despite their delayed release, these movies are finding an enthusiastic audience in the north, where theatres are hungry for fresh content, even if they lack the grandeur of blockbusters likeRRRandKGF.\nAlso read |\nFor instance, Vikram-starrerThangalaanearned nearly₹70 crore in Tamil Nadu, while the horror comedy,Demonte Colony 2, surpassed₹35 crore. Vijay Sethupathi’sMaharaja, which also premiered later in Hindi, had garnered over₹80 crore.\nHowever, since many of these southern films opted for OTT premieres within four weeks of their theatrical releases, multiplex chains like PVR Inox chose not to screen them in the north. Despite this, the films have offered some relief to non-national multiplexes and independent theatres.\n“Theatres are dealing with an extreme lack of content, so anything that catches the audience’s attention is great for us,” said Pranav Garg, managing director, Maya Palace, a two-screen cinema in Muzaffarnagar.\nGarg acknowledged that while these niche films provide some relief, their appeal is not as widespread as major southern hits likeRRRandKGF: Chapter 2, which enjoyed extensive marketing and simultaneous pan-India releases.\nAlso read |\nFurthermore, the stars of these Tamil films are less known in the Hindi belt compared to more popular actors such as Prabhas and Allu Arjun.\n“We may not have been able to play these films had there been big titles scheduled alongside. But at the moment, there are no major films releasing and we need content to feed the cinemas. As things are right now, we are not in a position to even break even with staff salaries, electricity and maintenance charges to take care of,” Garg added.\nThe shift in release patterns has also influenced the screening of these films. Prior to the covid-19 pandemic, the gap between a film's theatrical release and OTT premiere was around eight weeks. However, with cinemas closed for extended periods, many movies started premiering on streaming platforms much sooner.\nAlthough exhibitors expected a return to the old release schedules, this hasn’t happened uniformly. Tamil filmmakers, in particular, have increasingly opted for shorter OTT windows, which has impacted multiplex revenues.\nConsequently, chains like PVR Inox are hesitant to screen these southern films in the Hindi belt.\n“These films (likeThangalaan) have done well in their respective home states and shown that there is an audience for them. During periods of lull when there isn’t much occupancy in theatres anyway, people are experimenting with such strategies to at least attract some niche viewers,” Rahul Puri, managing director, Mukta Arts and Mukta A2 Cinemas said.\nMovie screens are free, so the goal is to offer more choices to fill seats” Puri said, adding that the target audience for these films often includes people from South India living in the Hindi belt.\n“At the time that these films had released in the south, there were several Hindi movies arriving in theatres. Now, there are none, so a delayed release makes sense. Plus, many southern heroes are slowly turning into pan-India names and there is definite traction for these movies,” Ashutosh Agarwal, owner of Star World Cinemas in Uttar Pradesh, said.\n\nCatch all the,and Updates on Live Mint.

With formation of the new government, a meeting of the committee was held on Monday to reconstitute it.\nIn his address, the Home Minister said Hindi was in a way associated with employment and technology now. The government was also making special efforts to integrate all the new-age technologies with Hindi, he said. In the past 10 years, the committee had tried to ensure that Hindi became a friend of all local languages ​​and did not compete with any language. “We should take care that the speakers of any local language do not have an inferiority complex and that Hindi is generally accepted as the language of work with consensus and agreement,” he said. Without competing with any Indian language, “we need to increase the acceptance of Hindi”, he said.\nMr. Shah said the Department of Official Language was developing a software that would automatically translate all the languages in the Eighth Schedule on a technical basis. “Once this work is completed, Hindi will gain acceptance and evolve in our work at a very fast pace,” he said.\nHe added that in the last five years, the government had given three large volumes of the committee’s report to the President, which had never happened before.\n“We have to move forward with such a goal that on Independence Day in 2047, our country’s entire work will be done in Indian languages ​​with pride. We have to give a new life to the 1,000-year-old Hindi language, make it accepted and try to complete the task left before us by the freedom fighters,” the Minister said.\nMr. Shah said that under the Munshi-Iyengar Committee, it was decided that a language commission, which would consider linguistic diversity, would be formed every five years, but it was forgotten.\nThe Parliamentary Committee on Official Language was constituted under the provisions of Section 4 of the Official Languages Act, 1963, in the year 1976. The committee comprises 30 members of Parliament, of which 20 are from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha.\nPublished- September 09, 2024 10:35 pm IST\n/\n|\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.
